**PROJECT OBJECTIVES**
1. Train and test a machine learning model capable of identifying mosquito species based on their wingbeat sounds.
2. Deploy the trained model on an edge device (Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense) for real-time detection.
3. Integrate the device with a wireless module (ESP32) to display detection results on a ThingSpeak dashboard.
  
**TECHNOLOGIES USED**
1. EdgeImpulse for training the machine learning model
2. Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense
3. ESP32 for Wi-Fi Communication
4. ThingSpeak for Dashboard Visualization
5. Python and Edge Impulse for Model Training
